Doodle Chain is a platform that counteracts creative quicksand by providing the starting point of a drawing. You need to complete or add to the drawing, and once finished hit "done & save." The doodle you started with will disappear, and what you drew will remain on the screen for the next user to come and add to the project. 

As more users participate in the game, more drawings get added to the chain. You can hit "play doodles" to see this evolution and see what happened before you came into play!

This game was created as my final project for my ICM class at ITP NYU.
